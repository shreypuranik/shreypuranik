### Hey there! Thanks for visiting my personal GitHub profile 👋

- 💻 I'm a software geek that loves radio and audio in general. By day I'm a software developer working in the audio services space.
- 📻 I volunteer at a charity community radio station in North West London (in a non technical role) 
- 🌱 My stack includes PHP, Go, TypeScript. 
- 🏋️‍♂️ I try and offset my screen time with gym time and my electro-acoustic guitar.

*Please note*: All projects here are non commercial and things I've built for personal use.
